hello ! 
during the test development I tried to stick to the practices below : 
1) start with the data - Nir Kaufman lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8THlN8hgcw
2) Decoupling - separate logic and view for more scalable, readable and maintainable app, (of course is not perfect)

3) simulate dependencies injection which helps the component be decoupled from the logic 
4) readable code and separate into small functions - uncle bob lecture part 1 
5) js performance - using of Set for easily remove duplications and map in order to reach a ~O(1) searching complexity 


notes : 
1) I know the styling is far away from good but I have no much time to fix it 
2) the graph view planed with max population proportion
